This program allows you to use the Microsoft C/C++ compiler (cl.exe) and related tools in a unix-like system, as if it was installed natively. Its main job is to convert unix-style paths on the command line to corresponding windows-style paths as seen from inside Wine, so the actual compiler is able to open and write files passed to it.
The wrapper was tested to work with CMake, altough this requires a patch to CMake.
Setup and usage instructions are in the README file in the source package.
